 * English locale overrides for the /soluciones/[slug] fallback content.
 *
 * Structure mirrors `solution-fallback-content.ts` exactly — same keys,
 * same arrays, same order — just translated to EN. When a slug is
 * missing from this map, `getSolutionFallback(slug, "en")` falls back
 * to the ES master content.
 *
 * Populated in PR #89 with curated EN copy for all 13 solution slugs.
 * Local-market references (ES-specific tools like Doctoralia, ITV,
 * Idealista) are replaced with UK/international equivalents where
 * meaningful; generic B2B tools (HubSpot, Salesforce, Twilio, OpenAI)
 * are kept verbatim.
 *
 * Partner slugs in `integrations` and cross-sell `sectorSlug` / `mockupSlug`
 * keep the ES master value — they are internal keys mapped to localized
 * URLs at render time via `cptPath()`.
